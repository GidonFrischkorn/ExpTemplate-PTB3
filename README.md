# ExpTemplate PTB3
This is a template for behavioral experiments programmed with MATLAB (or Ocatve) &amp; PTB 3

The template consists of a wrapper script that codes the general procedure of the experiment, a folder with MATLAB functions, a folder with instruction slides, and a folder for data back-up. In detail, the wrapper script opens a PTB window, displays general instructions, practice trials, and experimetal trials, before it saves all data and closes the PTB window. The MATLAB functions acsessed by the wrapper script provide different elementary functionality for the experiment (e.g. waiting for key presses, loading basic settings for the experiment, generating a trial list, or displaying a trial).
